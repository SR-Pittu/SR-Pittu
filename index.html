        <h3>HYBE INSIGHT MUSEUM</h3>
        <p>I am interested in Music. My favorite boy band is BTS. There is a museum in Seoul, South Korea called HYBE INSIGHT MUSEUM where you can see, hear, touch, and feel the power of music and our beliefs. The improved technology helps visitors ‘feel’ sound waves of the songs.
             One of the songs called 'Euphoria’ by BTS Jungkook can be ‘smelled’ in rooms due to the technologically advanced use of scents.</p>
        <b>HYBE INSIGHT a space where we share the power of music.I believe that the power of music can change the world</b>
