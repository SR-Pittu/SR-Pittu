# Hi, I'm Sobha 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science (GPA: 4.0) and hands-on experience building full stack applications, backend systems, AI-powered tools, and automation frameworks.

I specialize in backend development using Python and Java, and frontend development using React and JavaScript. I enjoy building scalable systems, integrating artificial intelligence into real-world applications, and improving software quality through automation and thoughtful system design.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build scalable backend services using Python (FastAPI, Flask) and REST APIs  
- Develop full stack web applications using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS  
- Integrate Large Language Model APIs to build intelligent developer tools  
- Design automation frameworks using Cypress, Katalon, Playwright, and Postman  
- Work with SQL and databases for data analysis and backend processing  
- Deploy and maintain applications using cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines

## 🧠 Featured Project

### Subtext AI — Silent Requirements Detector  
AI-powered tool that analyzes user stories, acceptance criteria, and documents to detect ambiguities, missing edge cases, and implicit assumptions.

**Tech stack:** Python, FastAPI, React, LLM APIs, Pydantic, Tailwind CSS  

- Detects ambiguous requirements and hidden assumptions  
- Generates structured findings and clarifying questions  
- Supports document upload and structured analysis  
- Built with production-ready backend architecture
